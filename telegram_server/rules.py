Each player starts having five dice and a cup, which is used for shaking the dice and concealing the dice from the other players.
The players shake their dice in their cups, and then each player looks at their own dice, keeping their dice concealed from other players. 
Then, the first player makes a bid about how many dice of a certain value are showing among all players, at a minimum. 
For example, a bid of "five threes" is a claim that between all players, there are at least five dice showing a three.
The player challenges the next player (moving clockwise) to raise the bid or call dudo(I doubt that/ you are bluffing) to end the round.

Raise
also known as "bid" in most versions, a player can increase the quantity of dice (e.g. from "five threes" to "six threes") or the die number (e.g. "five threes" to "five sixes") or both. 
If a player increases the quantity, they can choose any number e.g. a bid may increase from "five threes" to "six twos".
Call
also known as dudo, if the player calls, it means that they do not believe the previous bid was correct. 
All dice are then shown and, if the guess is not correct, the previous player (the player who made the bid) loses a die. 
If it is correct, the player who called loses a die. A player with no dice remaining is eliminated from the game.
After calling, a new round starts with the player that lost a die making the first bid, or (if that player was eliminated) the player to that player's left.
The game ends when only one player has dice remaining; that player is the winner.

Aces (dice showing a one) are wild, meaning that they count as every number.
For example, a bid of "five threes" is a claim that between all players, there are at least five dice showing a three or an ace. """
